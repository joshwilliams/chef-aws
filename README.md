Description
===========

This cookbook extends the stock aws cookbook by providing an access keys resource for keys stored in encrypted data bags.

Requirements
============

This cookbook expects to be named 'aws_keys' due to the recipe's resource name reference.  It can likely be changed to something else with that recipe updated appropriately if needed.

Of course an Amazon Web Services account is required. The Access Key and Secret Access Key are used to authenticate with EC2.
